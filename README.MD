Celestial: An accurate universe simulator

Good luck, barely been tested and the UX is insanely terrible. 
It's all commandline based and the only documentation is sparse comments in the code.

Available funcs (incomplete):
* system.pause() --> pauses
* system.resume() --> resumes
* system.resize() --> takes string argument ending in 'px' pr '%'. Percent takes the smallest width/height
